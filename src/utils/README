These are some simple utilities for starting gproc on clusters. We use
startkane to launch a two-level tree. For example, if we want to run
on nodes 201 through 400, we would start "gproc m", then run
"startkane -l 200 -h 400 1" to start the first level of the tree, then
"startkane -l 200 -h 400 2" to start the second level.
